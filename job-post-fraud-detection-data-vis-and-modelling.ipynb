We operate across a range of industries and technologies, and in a short space of time working for Sandfield, you’ll gain experience and skills that would have taken years to build up at other organisations.You’ll get the satisfaction of seeing a project through from beginning to end and being acknowledged for a job well done.

People are no longer satisfied with simply \"hearing\" a brand's message; now it's the actual experiences we have with a brand that define its relevance—emotionally, socially and when it's time to buy. That's why Momentum Worldwide helps brands imagine, create, curate and manage their Total Brand Experience.From the screens you watch, to the registers you pay at, to your Facebook, to your actual conversations, to the concerts you go to, we put brands there in a way that’s different and entertaining. We integrate sponsorship, shopper, design, technology, social, promotions, PR, digital and entertainment and more – in a total brand experience for the modern consumer.Quite simply, our job is to help brands flourish – and we do this as one global agency (within the IPG family of agencies) with more than 30 offices around the world – all of us working together, eager to invent, challenge the norm and set the world on fire.To make that possible, we hire people who are ravenous for ingenuity and impatient with the status quo. We like good people, and we like really thrilling people. When those two things come together it’s a talent experience for the books. The biggest asset we have is our talent, and we take that seriously. Part of the IPG agency network, we have over 30 offices on six continents with more than 2,000 amazingly talented people in our family working together. And, it’s kind of awesome to be a part of a company working with some incredible brands, including American Express, Coca-Cola, Mondelez, Microsoft, Walmart, William Grant &amp; Sons and more. Why not join us? You could be a member of a growing team of people who love to imagine, concept, create, sculpt, sing, emote and dream in the interests of our clients and communities. We think it’s a special kind of calling. You should answer.\n",

We need to find the one person who's the right fit for us... the right skills, the right mindset... somebody who will fit into our culture.

            "  - About Zingle: The idea behind Zingle was conceived by its founder, Ford Blakely. He was tired of waiting in long lines every morning at his local coffee shop for his \"single shot, soy mocha, 2 pumps, no whip\". An avid texter, Ford couldn't believe businesses did not have a way to receive text messages. Ford bought a cell phone for the coffee shop to keep by the register so he could text his order in each morning.I hate 2 wait for most anything!\"The idea quickly caught on and out-grew the capability of a cell phone. He thought, if he saves 15 minutes each morning by texting in his order, then more businesses could benefit from texting. Working with operators, Ford then created Zingle, a business text solution that allows customers to text a business (or automatically print the text request) and responds to customers with a confirmation, while also keeping a log of all recent requests and conversations.\n",
